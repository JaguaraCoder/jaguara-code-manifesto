# Jaguara Standards For Software Development (JSSD)
Jaguara Manifesto For Software Development and how to get (or not) frustated on a Software environment

## Main Purpose
The JSSD Manifesto is an expressive document on topics that usually gets software developers, managers and engineers frustated, or with general decisions or with burocratic processes or some smart-ass collegue that believes that perfection is the deliverable value of a product, sometimes we just need an action and a step-ahead without thinking too much to get things done.

## The Jaguara Itself
A jaguara is an expression to define someone that does or something that is conceived with minimum effort and usually without much planning nor thinking in the future people/products that may be affected by it.

Could be summarized as a combination of laziness and smartness(?) in a effort to avoid effort.

#### Lifestyle
The Jaguara has a peculiar lifestyle that could be summarized as:
- Prefers meetings than work
- First to complain, last to give a good solution
- Worried on moving tickets on the board just to show managers
- Usually involved in team parties and events
- Doesn't know what is delivery of value

## Topics that surrounds a Jaguara's environment

- Golive - Random release dates created by someone that doesn't know nothing about Software Development
         * other phrases that a persons who creates the golive might say:

           "It's our promise to deliver this feature"

           "We are an agile team"
- Constant confusion and incompetence
- Confused/excited
- Solving project delays and conflicts with team events
- Testing is for weaks. Don't you thrust your own code?
- desalignment as agile technique
- Let's do what we do better - meetings
- Solving project delays and conflicts with team events
- Creating hidden problems to boost your success in future fixes 
- Better done than perfect
- Better done than working

- Be on meetings and still be productive
- Agile until the deadline is closer
- Showing agile in stand-ups 
- The fantastic meetings factory 
- Team events speeding up product delivery 
- How to be slow using agile

- Spending time on resources that stakeholders don't care about

### Quality code doesn’t matter
Maybe the first and most important topic on a Jaguara's environemnt.

What does quality code brings to a Jaguara's health and actual life? More stress, more discussions with collegues to find the perfect code, and all that for what? Customers, Project Managers and everyone else than you does not care about that, with a chance to get complained for delivering or delaying the work.
In these cases, applying the Jaguara Standards, do the job as confortable as you want, delivery in time, accept comments on git, fix when the criticals come.

### SPPaaP - Slider de Powerpoint As a Product
This is a Jaguara concept used on many comapnies where managers (or sometimes even the company) may think that presenting an idea on a metting with a fancy presentation is already a product, of course the presentations must be pushed every X days to remember that it is a product even if nobody does nothing. In summary, company thinks that things are going, Managers think they are doing something or the company, and the team waits to some decision to start to do something.

Sometimes the company have many products as just presentation but in the end it is just a jaguara's technique to pretend that you are working on something.
