Jaguara Code Manifesto and how to not get frustated as a Software Developer

## Main Purpose
The Jaguara Code Manifesto is an expressive document on topics that usually gets software developers and engineers frustated, or with managers decisions or with burocratic processes or some smart-ass collegue that believes that perfection is the deliverable value of a product, sometimes we just need an action and a step-ahead without thinking too much to get things done.

## The Jaguara Itself
A jaguara is an expression to define someone or something that is conceived with minimum effort and usually without much planning nor thinking in the future people/products that may be affected by it.

Could be summarized as a combination of laziness and smartness(?) in a effort to avoid effort.

### Quality code doesn’t matter
What does quality code brings to your health and actual life? More stress, more discussions with collegues to find the perfect code, and all that for what? Customers, Project Managers and everyone else than you does not care about that, with a chance to get complained for delivering or delaying the work.
In these cases, applying the Jaguara Standards, do the job as confortable as you want, delivery in time, accept comments on git, fix when the criticals come.

### SPPaaP - Slider de Powerpoint As a Product
This is a Jaguara concept used on many comapnies where managers (or sometimes even the company) may think that presenting an idea on a metting with a fancy presentation is already a product, of course the presentations must be pushed every X days to remember that it is a product even if nobody does nothing.
